# CMS deployment and configuration

NLTP CMS is built on Strapi. With Strapi you can easily manage your content in the NLTP project. This document describes created models for the NLTP project and their use cases. To better understand Strapi basics, it is suggested to get familiar with the official Strapi [documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html).

## Importing assets

When deploying CMS for the first time, a manual file import is necessary.

Files from `cms_files.zip` must be manually copied to `cms-data-pv-claim` storage. You can use these commands to do that (CMS component must be deployed and running beforehand):

```bash
POD=`kubectl get pod | grep cms | awk {'print $1'}` # Find CMS Pod name
kubectl cp cms_files.zip $POD:/tmp/cms_files.zip # Copy archive to server
kubectl exec $POD -- sh -c "unzip -o /tmp/cms_files.zip -d /opt/app/public/uploads/" # Extract files
```

**Note:** Uploading files using the admin panel is not supported, as it will generate different filenames from the ones listed in the SQL file.

## Changing the default admin account password

The default admin password must be changed to prevent unauthorized access.

In order to change the password for the default admin account visit `https://nltp-cms.example.com/admin/settings/users/1`, login with default credentials:

* User: `cmsuser@example.com`
* Password: `CMSpass321`

Enter a new password and save.

# CMS Customization

Following section describes how to customize CMS content after deployment.

## Content manager

You can add and manage your content in the Content manager page.

### Menu items

This content type is created for adding custom menu items in side nav and mobile menu. Please, be aware that "Languagetools" column from the menu is defined in the application and is not configurable from cms, it is possible to configure menu items that are under divider.

Fields:

*icon* - icon to be shown next to the item or when side nav is collapsed. This should be an image with **.svg** type.

*title* - menu item title.

*link* - link where the menu item should go. You can add relative ("/my-link") or absolute. Relative links in the menu library are treated as Angular routes (check 
_externalLink_ property for exceptions). 

*customID* - this gives element a custom id. Field can be left empty.

*disabled* - this property determines menu item visibility. If you want to hide menu item, set it to true.

*externalLink* - opens link in new tab.

*plausibleEvent* - event for Plausible analytics, if it is used. You can leave this empty if Plausible is not used in the app. Check [Plausible event](#plausible-event) for more details. 

#### Menu item icon color

There might be cases when the selected icon is not changing color to accent color. The color might be hard coded and there is no (or not good) way to change it from front-end code. If you want the icon to also be colored, you need to edit the icons' `.svg` file manually.

Menu lib has styles that set icon color for the selected element (to accent color). The library expects icon elements that should be colored to have fill property set to currentColor.

First step is to open the icons file in a text editor (notepad or any other of your choice):

Here is example svg of icon where currentColor is not working:

![image.png](./attachments/strapi-manual/menu-item-incorrect-svg.png)

As we can see,  the designer has created a custom class st0 whose fill attribute is set to some color. In the front-end, we could override these classes styles to achieve the desired result, but that would not be the best solution, since some random class names are not good practice and there are no rules in Tilde what classes should be formatted.

**Steps to fix this svg file:**

+ remove 
`.st0{fill:#647280;}` from svg file (if `<style>` tag is empty, remove it also).
+ remove `class="st0"` from path tags
+ add `fill="currentColor"` to `<svg> tag`

file after editing:
